##Inspiration

Ever been in a group chat with several people? I have and it can be annoying at times! Everytime when someone posts something important it often gets drowned by a slew of messages. So we came up with an idea to alleviate that issue, by allowing users to branch conversations. This also allows users to graphically follow the conversation and users who are new to the group will have no trouble following the conversation.

##What it does

It allows the user to create branches within the conversation so that they only see the messages related to that topic! Right now you would have to sift through 100s of messages to figure out what is being discussed in a conversation, but with tree chat its as simple as following the tree.

##How we built it

We used node.js, express, socket.io and jQuery mixing it with html/css to do the backend and frontend. Then we hosted the server on the linode server.

##Challenges we ran into

We ran into some challenges with the backend when we were connected onto two different laptops.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of

We have never worked with socket.io before so to see it up and running within a relatively short time was something good to see.
What we learned

We have learned that creating the backend is not the easiest thing in the world.

##What's next for TreeChat

We are working on it to try and make it mobile friendly, and have it connect to other social services. In the far future it would be cool to integrate some natural language processing to intelligently branch the conversation and the user doesnt have to.
